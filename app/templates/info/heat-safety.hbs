      <p>
        Hot and humid weather challenge your body's ability to cool itself. You or someone you care about may experience a heat-related illness if you heat too rapidly for your body to cool itself, or if you lose too much fluid or salt through dehydration or sweating.

      <p>
        Check on your neighbors to make sure they're doing okay. People's lives have been saved in heat wave thanks to neighbors taking a moment to check in on others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure not to leave pets or children in cars, even if the windows are open. Cars quickly overheat on hot days.
